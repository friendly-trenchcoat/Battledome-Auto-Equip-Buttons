# Battledome-Auto-Equip-Buttons
Adds personalized buttons to the battledome which apply a preset weapon/ability configuration.

<b>INSTRUCTIONS</b><br>
The faerie ability URLs are listed below the main() function.
For each item you have equipped, find its image URL. For quick reference, I suggest pasting them below with the faerie abilities.

Inside each 'on click' function, simply paste in the appropirate urls for the items/abilities you wish to assign.
If you have multiples of a weapon, you may specify which one should be used. For the first (or if there's only one) use 0, for the second use 1, for the third use 2, etc.

You may add more buttons--just be sure to give each one a unique id (defaultset4, defaultset5, etc.)
